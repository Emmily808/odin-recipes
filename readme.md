Hi, this is my first project in The Odin Project and in the web development world in general. I don't know yet if this is for me, but for the moment, i like it, so i just trying to develop new skills and learn something new. In this project i will demostrate that i can make a webpage in HTML and also understand it, in inglish. So, if i read this in the future and i will ended completing The odin project curriculum, i will be demostrate myself that i just can learn new things.
